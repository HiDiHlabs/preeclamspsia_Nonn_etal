Consists of python scripts & notebooks dedicated towards the analysis of control and pre-eclamptic (diseased) placenta analysis using single nuclei RNA-seq data. 


Understanding the order & function of the scripts:

I). SP014_SP082_cellbender_placenta_QC_270122_S0.py: 
Making a concatenated Cellbender processed, scanpy QC filtered & log-normalized object for SP014 (10X V2) & SP082 (10X V3) object. 
Metadata store were verified from scRNAseq_metadata_early_controls.xlsx; obtained from Dr. Florian Herse on 13.11.2021. 
Also, explores the quality control comparison of SP014 and SP082 cohort. 
The output H5AD file were subsequently used for training & testing (celltypist) below & other downstream analysis. 

II) Placenta_celltypist_control_predictions_28012022_S1.ipynb:  
Using CellTypist based automated Logistic regression classifiers optimized by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. 
The notebook will enable (preliminary) cell-annotation prediction using our previous snRNA-seq placenta dataset (SP014 cohort controls; from 2021 submission) as a 
"training dataset." The test data was newly processed Cellbender data (merged with SP082 early samples) from Step-I. 
The purpose was mainly to classify the control villi test data (as the SP136 disease samples were sequenced later in March'22) & only use a reference to 
inspect the (unsupervised) Leiden clusters. Hence, the predictions don't refer to final annotations. 

III). Placenta_atlas_integration_controls_LV15_280122_S2.py: 
Data harmonization of SP014 (control) & SP082 early first-trimester samples and perform differential marker analysis for cell annotations. 
The analysis was restricted to controls-only because of the earlier availability of these samples (sequenced by January'22). 
The PE samples were integrated later in April'22 since the SP136 samples were sequenced late. The notebook serves as an initial analysis of control villi. 

IV). Placenta_scVI_controls_exploratory_celltyping_LV15_S3.ipynb:
Exploratory analysis of the Leiden clusters- using known markers, LDA & qualitative visualization of integration (data structures). 

V). Placenta_controls_clustering_exploratory_LV15_S4.ipynb: 
Mapping of the Leiden clusters to a cell type/state annotation based on marker analysis of the control villi. 
Note that, certain annotations were refined later based on trajectory analysis and further investigation. 
Notebooks from step III & IV are separately shown for visualizing the ground work went into the analysis. 

VI). Trajectory_analysis_trophoblasts_22032022.ipynb: 
Reconstruction of trophoblast differentiation using STREAM & finding pseudotime based marker genes. 

VII). SP014_SP082_SP136_placenta_scvi_harmonization_25032022.py:
Data harmonization of all placenta samples (SP014, SP082 & SP136) using single-cell variational inference (scVI): a scalable framework for the 
probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate 
information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the distributions that underlie observed expression values.

scVI performs excellently for complex integration tasks & is highly recommended by Luecken et. al Nature Methods 2021. 
It's known to maintain a balance between batch mixing and bio-conservation of clusters after harmonization. 
- k-nearest neighbors purity that ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values meaning better preservation of neighbor structure in the individual datasets after harmonization.
- Entropy of batch mixing where higher values mean that the cells from different datasets are well mixed.

P.S: The term harmonization (rather than batch effect correction) emerged to emphasize that the input transcriptomic datasets may come from 
very different sources (e.g., tech/lab/library chemistry) and from samples with a different cell type/state composition. 

VIII). Placenta_marker_analysis_LogisticRegression_290322.r:
Placenta cell type/state marker analysis using multi-variate Logistic Regression. 
Corrected for latent variables/confounders such as "nCount_RNA", "nFeature_RNA", "percent.mt" (continuous covariates), ~disease (control vs PE) 
and library (10X V3 vs 10X V2) to prevent the effects of technical artifacts on DEG selection. 

IX). Placenta_analysis_manuscript_2022.ipynb: 
Major manuscript analysis: including UMAP visualization of placenta cell types/states (main figure-1C; villi); tabulating cell type/state composition 
per conditions & analyzing composition changes between gestational time-points and evaluation of data harmonization (inc. batch-effect correction).

X). PE_vs lateC_marker_analysis_LogisticRegression.r: 
To determine the differentially expressed genes for disease (eoPE) against late controls, the LR framework (implemented Seurat’s FindMarkers function) was applied 
to respective cell types/states. The number of UMI, #gene counts, percentage of mitochondrial transcripts, and the percentage of sex-specific transcripts per nuclei
were used as continuous covariates. Importantly, a cell type/state-specific preterm-score was calculated using the significant preterm vs. term DEGs. 
This was explicitly performed to prevent strong preterm specific effects in the analysis since eoPE arises 6-8 weeks before healthy term. 
 
Since no differential features were separately reported for the vSTB preterm, the other trophoblast genes (reported for vCTB) were used for correction. 
Additionally, SLIT2 & ROBO1 have been included in the module-score based correction as they are associated with risk for spontaneous preterm birth. 
Cell type/state-specific labor signatures were considered for correction by extracting the term in-labor vs. no-labor differential genes from respective groups. 
Only those genes having a log2 fold-change cut-off of 0.25 and expressed in at least 10% of cells within each group were reported as significant, given adjusted 
p-value < 0.05 (Bonferonni corrected). Both up & down-regulated genes were reported. No cell type/state exhibited a significant composition shift in eoPE 
relative to the term controls (except for vHBC)- hence, down sampling was only performed for the vHBC. 

For cell types such as vCCT, dEVT, vCTBp, vCTBpf, dDSTB, dPC, dBcells no analysis was performed owing to extreme sparsity in the eoPE group. 
None of our samples were confounded with a major co-occurring disease. Also, we found no significant differences between maternal age or BMI between 
our PE and late control groups- hence, a statistical correction was not required.
