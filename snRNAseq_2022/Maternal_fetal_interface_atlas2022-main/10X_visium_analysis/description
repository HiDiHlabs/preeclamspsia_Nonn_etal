Seurat processing of the Visium count matrix: 
The 10x output folder was read using Load10X_Spatial function implemented in Seurat v3. The object was then normalzsed using SCTransform function. 
After that, PCA was calculated using RunPCA() and first 20 were selected for identifying the k-nearest neighbours of each spot with FindNeighbors function. 
Finally, clustering was performed via FindClusters (resolution = 0.2). 

Spotlight based deconvolution of Visium data: 
The spotlight object was generated using the spotlight_deconvolution function in SPOTlight (Version 0.1.7) by supplying the early villi subset 
(from the placental single- 1445 nuclei data) as reference. The marker table for the nuclei clusters was initially generated based on Logistic Regression 
method implemented in Seurat as discussed & subsequently filtered to yield the best topic profile representative of each cell type/state found in the dataset 
(will be made available on Zenodo).

The non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF - nsNMF) regression as well as Non-negative Least Squares (NNLS) regression were used for deconvolution as 
implemented in SPOTlight. Cells contributing to less than 1% of the spot composition were removed to tackle sparsity using min_cont = 0.01. 
The deconvoluted spots were assessed by investigating the topic profiles of the cell type (Extended Data Figure 1f) and the nature of individual topics within 
a cell type/state.
